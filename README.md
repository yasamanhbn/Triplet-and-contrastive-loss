# Triplet and Contrastive Loss
This repository contains two Python notebooks demonstrating the implementation of triplet and contrastive loss for similarity learning. Triplet and contrastive loss are commonly used in siamese and triplet network architectures for learning similarity and dissimilarity between data points.

## Contents

- `triplet_loss.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of triplet and contrastive loss using TensorFlow/Keras.
- `data/`: Directory containing sample datasets for testing the implementation.

## Usage

To use the notebook, simply open `TripletLoss.ipynb` or `Contrasive Loss.ipynb`in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The notebook contains detailed explanations and code for implementing triplet and contrastive loss, as well as examples of how to use them in training neural networks.

## Dependencies

The implementation in the notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pytorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pytorch numpy matplotlib
```
